# 🚦 Traffic Accidents Analysis – Power BI Dashboard  

## 📊 Overview  
This Power BI dashboard provides insights into **traffic accidents**, including accident severity, trends over different times of the day, urban vs. rural accident distribution, and the impact of traffic fines. The goal is to help authorities and policymakers identify accident patterns and take preventive measures.  

## 🛠️ Key Features  
- **Total Vehicles & Accident Rate** – Displays total vehicles and accidents per 1000 vehicles.  
- **Accident Severity Breakdown** – A pie chart showing the proportion of **minor, moderate, and severe** accidents.  
- **Fine Amount vs. Accident Rate** – Analyzes how traffic fines correlate with accident rates.  
- **Overall Accident Trends** – Line chart showing accident trends over different times of the day.  
- **Accidents in Urban vs. Rural Areas** – Bar chart comparing accident occurrences in **urban and rural** areas.  
- **Traffic Condition Filter** – Allows users to filter data by **high, medium, or low** traffic conditions.

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset used in this dashboard includes information on:  
- Accident locations (urban vs. rural)  
- Accident severity (minor, moderate, severe)  
- Time of day (morning, night, afternoon, early morning)  
- Number of vehicles involved

## 🚀 How to Use  
1. Download the `.pbix` file from this repository.  
2. Open it in **Power BI Desktop**.  
3. Explore the different visualizations and filters to gain insights.  

## 📢 Insights & Findings  
- **Accidents decrease throughout the day**, with the highest numbers occurring at **night**.  
- **Afternoon has the highest average fine amount**, but accidents are still significant.  
- **Urban areas have more accidents** compared to rural areas.  
- **Moderate accidents are the most common**, making up **53.23%** of all cases.  

## 📌 Future Improvements  
- Add **real-time accident data** using APIs.  
- Implement **predictive analytics** to forecast accident trends.  
- Include **geospatial analysis** to map high-risk accident zones.
